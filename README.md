#Contents: Inside all folders there is a report wich contains the description of each question (in Greek) where the following functions where used 

          #Folder 1 : Extended GCD (Euclid)
                      GCD Counter
                      Inversion 
                      Mod Inversion (m^-1 mod n)
         
         #Folder 2 : euclid_triang (prs calculator with euclid array triangulation)
         
         #Folder 3 : new_euclid ( modified Extended GCD that returns the list of partial quotients )
                     Cont_Fractions (continued fractions calculator)
                     K_method (implementation of Kioutselidis method of finding upper bound in a polyonom)
                     VCA+VAG_methods (division methods based on Vincent theorem)
                     
                     *inside VCA+VAG_methods there is also the continued fractions method VAS
